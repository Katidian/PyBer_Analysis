# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.


## Results
Revenues are clearly highest in urban markets, although fares are 


There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.


## Summary

The path forward for PyBer depends on the company's goals in different geographic areas. 

If the top priority is to increase market share -- with less focus on fare increases -- PyBer should find ways to add drivers, particularly in suburban and 
rural areas. The more PyBer drivers are available to give rides at any given moment, the more likely customers are to choose PyBer for their trip. Also,
rural and suburban trips likely tend to be longer in terms of distance, since homes and businesses are more spread out. This means that every trip added
in one of these locations is likely to drive more revenue than a trip added in an urban area.

The relatively high number of drivers in urban areas, combined with the lower fares, suggests that urban markets may be close to saturation with ride-sharing 
drivers. PyBer customers may enjoy a price advantage in urban markets, given the larger number of drivers available through PyBer (and presumably other ride-sharing 
services). Here PyBer should focus on optimizing its pricing strategy, perhaps by limiting the number of drivers on urban streets at certain times. This could 
create some driver scarcity that could justify higher fares. However, this strategy could backfire if implemented poorly, since customers will turn elsewhere if 
PyBer's service is not convenient or timely.

There are two factors that could account for the higher fares in rural areas. First, rural rides are most likely longer in terms of distance, given the fact that
homes and businesses are more geographically spread out than in urban areas. Second, depending on how PyBer's ride-matching algorithm works, the relative scarcity 
of drivers in rural areas may drive up fares. With few PyBer drivers on the rural roads, there is less competition for customers and greater capacity to charge 
higher prices. 

I recommend gathering more data that can drive more nuanced analysis of ride and fare trends. Data on trip distance would help PyBer assess the extent to which
fares in certain areas are higher because of trip length or because of other factors. Data on customer wait times and frequency of canceled trips would be useful 
for determining the extent to which PyBer is adequately meeting customer demand in various locations. For example, if customers in rural areas regularly have to 
wait a long time for a driver to pick them up, this suggests that it could be worthwhile to entice more people to drive for PyBer in these locations.
